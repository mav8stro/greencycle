# 🧠 Overview

GreenCycle Nexus is a modern civic waste management platform designed to digitize and automate waste collection workflows using a role-based system architecture.

The platform simulates a real-world government-style infrastructure where citizens can log waste, administrators can approve collection requests, and workers can manage pickup operations efficiently.

The system focuses on:
- ♻️ Waste management automation
- 🏛 Civic workflow digitization
- 📊 Analytics and monitoring
- 💰 Automated payment systems
- 🚛 Smart pickup scheduling
- 👥 Multi-role access management

GreenCycle Nexus aims to modernize traditional waste management operations using scalable digital systems and intelligent workflow automation.

---

# 🌍 Real World Problem

Traditional waste management systems often face:

```text
• Manual paperwork
• Delayed approvals
• Poor collection tracking
• Inefficient scheduling
• Lack of transparency
• Weak communication systems
• Unorganized payment processes
```

Most local civic systems still rely heavily on manual coordination, which leads to:
- operational inefficiencies
- delayed collections
- poor accountability
- citizen dissatisfaction

GreenCycle Nexus solves these challenges through a centralized digital workflow platform.
